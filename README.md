# What is this branch
This branch was an initial attempt at improving how Terramap did and cached http requests. It switched to Terra++ along the way, and that already had, or was getting all that Terramap needed. It therefore did not make sens to maintain two cache systems, and this one got scratched out in favor of Terra++'s.
This branch is only for prosperity and it isn't planned to do anything with it.
