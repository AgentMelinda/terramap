# Terramap
An addon mod to Terra1:1 providing an map in-game of the world with various perks, including easy teleportation without having to copy-paste the gps coordinates from a web browser, or open various map websites at the desired location directly from the game.

Terramap will work best if it is installed both on the server and the client. This is because it needs to syncronize the map projection used by the server to the client, but it is still usable if installed only on the client, as long as you take the time to manually set the projection used (For the Build the Earth Project, this is bteairocean, with upright as the orientation).

Terramap is still in beta, si it's likely to have a few bugs and still lacks intended features. It also has no translation yet.
