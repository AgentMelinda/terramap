# terramap
An addon mod to terra121 providing an OpenStreetMap tiled map in-game for easier teleportation to new places and avoiding having to constantly copy-paste coordinates from a web browser.

It's mainly client-side but still needs to be installed on the server to keep the client in sync with the projection used.

It' still in early dev and will evolve, but here is what it currently looks like:

### Currently implemented:
* A basic full screen tiled map
* A right click menu on the map to teleport and open the location in various third-party tools

### Planned:
* Display nearby players and maybe entities
* Better control over the map
* Waypoints
